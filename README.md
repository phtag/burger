# Burger Logger

Week 14 homework assignment


### Overview
This project uses Node.js, Express, MySQL and Handlebars to create an application that allows a user to enter burgers they would like  to eat and display them in a list. The web page for this application allows them to click a button next to each lister burger to indicate that they have now eaten the burger. When a burger's button is clicked, the burger is moved from the list of burgers to be eaten (which appears on the left side of the web page) to the list of burgers that have been eaten (which appears on the right side of the page).

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to integrate a node.js server using Express that services different routes from a web-based client. The server logic uses Handlebars to dynamically render web pages to the client.

### Getting Started
To use the Burger Logger application, go to the Heruko link: https://sleepy-temple-45120.herokuapp.com/

Start by entering burger names in the input text field. Click the "Add burger" button to add your named burger to the list of uneaten burgers on the left of the page.

You can also click on the link in the footer of the page to view a list of all friends on the site and how they answered their survey questions.
